===================

A collection of scripts to aid with a workflow based around
resources behind firewalls, but with SSH access. Future 
improvements including a single interface to come later. 

### Motivation

Many times it might not be possible to completely open up 
firewalls, either for security or access purposes. In the case
where a full fledged VPN may be too much setup, a SSH tunnel
based workflow might be a great solution. Especially for VNC
sessions, SSH tunnels provide a lightweight and relatively 
pain-free way to access remote resources.
